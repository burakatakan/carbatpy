"""
Example script for a (simple) counter flow heat exchamnger evaluation
Reading from an input yaml file
calculating, plotting and writimg the results to new files and storing them with 
date and time in a results directory. The main result are now stored as an
excel file (see heat_exchanger.he_state())
